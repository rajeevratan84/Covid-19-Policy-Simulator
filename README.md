# Covid-19-Policy-Simulator

A simple RShiny App that simulates changes in covid-19 infection rates when government restriction policies change. It can be adapted for any country, however this version is tailored specifically for Trinidad and Tobago. 

It uses a simple SIR model and changes in policy correspond to changes in Rnaught.
